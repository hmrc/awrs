# HIP Migration Document

#### All decisions regarding HIP migration should be made here. 

### Initial Changes

1. We have decided to keep changes as minimal as possible within this repository and within the service as a whole. Based on this decision, we have kept any changes required within the service file. For example, we have had to manipulate JSON received from the API to match the model on the front end.
